# HW3A Solution - Git and Version Control
## Part 1: Repository Cloning
I successfully cloned the class repository from `https://github.com/olearydj/INSY6500` to
`~/insy6500/class_repo`.

### Key Commands Used
- `git clone <url>` - Create local copy of remote repository
- `git log` - View commit history
- `git remote -v` - Check remote repository connections
## Part 2: Portfolio Repository Creation
I created my personal course repository with:
- Professional README.md describing the project
- Proper .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Organized directory structure for homework, projects, and notes
### Understanding Git Workflow
The three-stage workflow:
1. Working Directory: Where I edit files
2. Staging Area: Where I prepare commits with `git add`
3. Repository: Where commits are permanently stored with `git commit`
